Prabhupāda: Hare Kṛṣṇa. Read.
Gargamuni: Fourteen.
Prabhupāda: Yes.
Gargamuni: The last sentence. "This point is confirmed by the Bhagavad-gītā in the Seventh Chapter, where parā and aparā prakṛti are discussed. The elements of nature—earth, fire, water, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego—all belong to the inferior, or material, energy of the Lord, whereas the living being, the organic energy, is the superior energy, the parā prakṛti, of the Lord. Both the prakṛtis, or energies, are emanations from the Lord, and ultimately He is the controller of everything that exists. There is nothing in the universe which does not belong either to the parā or aparā prakṛti, and therefore everything is under the..."
Prabhupāda: "...proprietary right of the Supreme Being." So here, in the Īśopaniṣad also, the same thing is explained, that īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. Whatever we are seeing, animate or inanimate, there is control of the Supreme Lord. The same thing is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā, that His energies are working.
In the Viṣṇu Purāṇa it is said just like fire staying in one place distributes its heat and light... Eka-deśa-sthitasyāgner jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā. Agni, agni means fire. Fire is... Just like the sun. Sun is also fire, very high temperature fire. So it is staying in one place, but it is distributing its light and heat all over the universe. Eka-deśa-sthitasyāgner jyotsnā yathā vistāriṇī tathaiva parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 1.22.53]. Similarly, two energies from the Supreme Lord is being distributed all over the creation. One kind of energy is called material energy, and the other kind of energy is called the spiritual energy.
So in this world, in this temporary material world, the spiritual energy is there. That is prominent. But it is covered by the material energy. Just like there is sunshine—sunshine, nobody can check—but it is sometimes covered by cloud. When it is covered by the cloud, the sunshine is dim. The more it is covered... Just like in Western countries, in the northern countries, it is very much covered. Practically, there is no sunshine. In London I saw the sunshine is very rare. At ten o'clock it is early in the morning, and at half past three again evening, so long I was there.
So this covering of the sunshine is temporary. Actually, sunshine cannot be covered. The whole sunshine cannot be covered. That is not possible. An insignificant portion of the sunshine may be covered, or is covered sometimes by the cloud. Similarly, this material world is an insignificant portion of the spiritual world, covered by this material energy. That's all. And what is the position of material energy? The material energy is also another form of the spiritual energy. That means absence of spiritual activity, that is material. That's all.
Just like what is this cloud? This cloud is another transformation of the sunshine. The sunshine evaporates water from the sea, and the cloud is formed. Therefore sunshine is the cause of the cloud. Similarly, this material energy is also caused by the Supreme Lord, because it is His energy.
So two energies are working in this material world: the spiritual energy and the material energy. The material energy means these eight kinds of material elements, bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ [Bg. 7.4]: earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego. These are all material. And similarly, finer, finer, finer, finer, and grosser, grosser, grosser. Just like water is finer than the earth, then fire is finer than the water, then air is finer than the fire, then sky, or ether, is finer than the air. Similarly, intelligence is finer than the ether, or mind is finer than the ether. The mind... You know, I have given several times example: the speed of mind. Many thousands of miles within a second you can go.
So the finer it becomes, it is powerful. Similarly, ultimately, when you come to the spiritual part, finer, from which everything is emanating, oh, that is very powerful. That's spiritual energy. So that is given in the Bhagavad-gītā. What is that spiritual energy? That spiritual energy is this living entity. Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā [Bg. 7.5]. Kṛṣṇa says, "These are material energies. Beyond this there is another, spiritual energy." Apareyam. Aparā means inferior. Apareyam. "All these described material elements, they're inferior energy. And beyond this there is superior energy, My dear Arjuna." What is that? Jīva-bhūta mahā-bāho: "These living entities."
They are also energy. We living entities, we are also energy, but superior energy. How superior? Because yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat [Bg. 7.5]. The superior energy is controlling the inferior energy. Matter has no power. The big airplane, nice machine, is flying in the sky, made of material things. But unless the spiritual energy, pilot, is there, it is useless. It is useless. Thousands of years the jet plane will stand on the airport; it will not be flying unless the small particle spiritual energy, that pilot, comes and touches.
So what is the difficulty to understand God? So plain thing, that if this huge machine... There are so many huge machineries; they cannot move without the touch of the spiritual energy, a human being or a living being. How can you expect that this whole material energy is working out of automatically or without any control? How you can put your arguments in that way? That is not possible.
Therefore less intelligent class of men, they cannot understand how this material energy is being controlled by the Supreme Lord. The godless men, those who are of opinions that this material energy is working automatically, they are fools. That is the explanation of Īśopaniṣad. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. Everything is being controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And therefore, because He is the supreme controller, therefore He is the supreme proprietor.
We can see in our practical experience, the man who controls the whole establishment, he is proprietor, or the president. Similarly, if it is being controlled by some superior person, then He is God. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā: mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram. Kṛṣṇa says, "Under My superintendence this material energy is working, and all these animate and inanimate objects are being produced."
mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ
sūyate sa-carācaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
[Bg. 9.10]
So unless there is some living force, energy, behind any material manifestation, it cannot work. If we simply understand this fact, that everywhere there is control of the Supreme Lord, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to understand things as it is. That's all.
Thank you very much. [devotees offer obeisances] [end]

Prabhupāda: Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **. Ādi-puruṣam, the original Personality of Godhead. So when we speak of Govinda, Govinda is not alone. Just like when we speak of a king, it is to be understood that king is not alone. He has got many other followers, secretaries, ministers, soldiers—whole state. Similarly, when we speak of Govindam, behind Govinda, with Govinda, all living entities, all creation, everything... Govindam. So you can st... [break]
Gargamuni: [reading] "It is also wrong to consider that simply by becoming a vegetarian one can save himself from transgressing the laws of nature. Vegetables also have life. One life is meant to feed another living being, and that is the law of nature. One should not be proud of being a strict vegetarian. The point is to recognize the Supreme Lord. The animals have no developed consciousness to recognize the Lord, but a human being..."
Prabhupāda: That is the main point. Just like there are the Buddhists, they are also vegetarian. According to Buddhist principle... Nowadays everything has deteriorated, but Lord Buddha's propaganda was to make the rascals at least to stop animal-killing. Ahiṁsā paramo dharma.
Lord Buddha's appearance is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and many Vedic literatures, sura-dviṣām. He came to cheat the demons. The demons... He made such a policy that the demons were cheated. How He has cheated? The demons, they are against God. They don't believe in God. So Lord Buddha propagated, "Yes, there is no God. But what I say, you follow." "Yes, sir." But He is God. [laughter] This is cheating. Yes. They do not believe in God, but they believe in Buddha, and Buddha is God. Keśava-dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare [Śrī Daśāvatāra Stotra 9].
So that is the difference between a demon and a devotee. A devotee sees that how Kṛṣṇa, Keśava, is cheating these rascals. The devotee can understand. But the demons, they think, "Oh, we have got a nice leader. He does not believe in God." [laughter] You see? [chuckles] Sammohāya sura-dviṣām [SB 1.3.24]. The exact Sanskrit word is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. You have seen, those who have read: sammohāya, for bewildering sura-dviṣām. Sura-dviṣām means persons who are envious of the Vaiṣṇavas.
The atheist class, demons, they are always envious of the devotees. That is the law of nature. You see this father. Father became an enemy of a five-years-old son. What was his fault? He was a devotee. That's all. Innocent boy. Simply he was, I mean to say, attracted with chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. The father himself, he became a staunch enemy: "Kill this boy." So if a father can become enemy, what to speak of others.
So you should always expect that as soon as you become a devotee, the whole world becomes your enemy. That's all. But you have to deal with them, because you are appointed servants of God. Your mission is to enlighten them. So you cannot be... Just like Lord Nityānanda, He was injured, but still He delivered Jagāi-Mādhāi. That should be your principle. Sometimes we have to cheat, sometimes we have to be injured—so many things. The only device is how people can become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our mission. Some way or other these rascals should be converted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, either this way or that way.
So Lord Buddha, he cheated the demons. Why he cheated? Sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam. He was very compassionate. God is always sympathetic to all living entities, because everyone is His son. So these rascals were killing unrestrictedly, simply animal killing... And if you say, "Oh, why you are animal-killing?" They will immediately say, "Oh, it is in the Vedas. Yes. Paśavo vadhāya sṛṣṭa." The animal killing is there in the Vedas, but what's the purpose? That is to test the Vedic mantra. An animal will be put into the fire, and by Vedic mantra he'll be rejuvenated. That is sacrifice, animal sacrifice. Not that for eating purpose.
Therefore in this age of Kali, Caitanya Mahāprabhu has forbidden any kind of yajña, because there is no, I mean to say, expert brāhmaṇa who can chant the mantras and make experiment of the Vedic mantras, that "Here is coming out." That is... Before performing yajña, how the mantra is potent, that was tested by sacrificing animal and again giving new life. Then it is to be understood that the priests who were chanting that mantra, that is right. That was a test. Not for animal killing.
But these rascals, for eating animals they cited, "Here, there is animal killing." Just like in Calcutta... You have been in Calcutta? And there is a street, College Street. Now it is differently named. I think it is named Vidhan Raya[?], just like... Anyway, so there are some slaughterhouses. So slaughterhouses means the Hindus, they do not purchase meat from Muslims' shop. That is impure. [laughter] The same thing: stool this side and that side. They are eating meat, [chuckles] and Hindu shop is pure, Muslim shop is impure.
These are mental concoction. Religion is going on like that. Therefore... Therefore fighting: "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Christian." Nobody knows religion. You see? They have given up religion, these rascals. There is no religion. The real religion is this, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which teaches how to love God. That's all. That is religion. Any religion, it doesn't matter whether Hindu religion, Muslim religion, Christian religion, if you are developing love of God, then you are perfect in your religion. Otherwise you are rascal; your religion is nonsense. That is the test.
sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharma
yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
ahaituky apratihatā
yayātmā suprasīdati
[SB 1.2.6]
This is Bhāgavata religion. That is first-class religion. What is that? Yataḥ, by executing the religious principles, if you develop your love for the Supreme, who is beyond expression of your words and beyond the activities of your mind... Adhokṣaja. This very word is used, adhokṣaja: where your material senses cannot approach. And what kind of that love? Ahaitukī, without any cause. "O Lord, I love You, God, because You supply me so many nice things. You are order-supplier." No. Not that sort of love. Without any exchange.
That is taught by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "Whatever You do..." Āśliṣya vā pada-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām [Cc. Antya 20.47]. "Either You trample Me under Your feet or You embrace Me... What You like. You make Me brokenhearted by not seeing You—that doesn't matter. Still You are My worshipable Lord." That is love. "From God's side, He may do whatever He likes. I don't want anything in exchange." That is love. That sort of love Kṛṣṇa wants.
Therefore He was so much fond of the gopīs. In the gopīs' love there was no question of business propaganda—"Give me this, then I love You." [chuckles] No. That is pure love. That is unalloyed love. Ahaituky apratihatā. Apratihatā means without being checked. No impediment. If you want to love God, there is nothing throughout the whole world which can check you. Simply you have to develop your eagerness: "Kṛṣṇa, I want You." That's all. Then there is no question of checking. In any condition you'll increase your love, increase your love. Ahaituky apra...
And why this? Yayātmā suprasīdati. If you attain that state, then you will feel fully satisfied. Otherwise not. Otherwise not. If you can develop your love for God, or Kṛṣṇa, without being checked, without any cause, then you will feel fully satisfied. Otherwise not. It is for your interest. And... It is not for God's interest that He wants you. It is for your interest. If you do otherwise, you will never be happy. This is the only way. Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ... [Bg. 18.66]
Therefore here it is stated, simply to become vegetarian is not the last word. There are many vegetarians. The monkey is vegetarian. [chuckles] He's naked and lives in a jungle. Just like there are so many so-called sages, that "I live naked. I live in the jungle. I have given up the society." So monkey is doing that. Huh? [laughter] Naked, vegetarian, no home. But the rascal has got at least two dozen wives. That is monkey.
So it is called markaṭa-vairāgya. He has become a sannyāsī, vairāgī, and, but, so much thing, but privately he has got so many connections. Yes. That is called markaṭa-vairāgya, monkey's renunciation. Monkey has renounced, naked, but, hah, at heart there is sense gratification. So markaṭa-vairāgya is no good. So simply to become vegetarian is no good. You must develop love of Godhead. That is real thing.
Thank you.

Gargamuni: "In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord directly states that He accepts the vegetable foodstuffs from the hands of a pure devotee. Therefore, a human being should not only become a strict vegetarian, but he should also become a devotee of the Lord and offer to the Lord all his food, and only then partake of the prasādam, or mercy of God. Such a devotee can properly discharge the duty of human life. Those who do not do so are eating only sins and thus will be subjected to the different types of distress which are the result of the various sins.
Prabhupāda: Yes. This is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, Fourth Chapter: yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ [Bg. 3.13]. Our this conditioned life is so situated that in every step we are committing some sins. In every step, without knowing, ignorance, because we, we are born ignorant. Therefore Bhāgavata says, parābhavas tāvad abhodha-jātaḥ [SB 5.5.5]. Abodha-jātaḥ. Abodha-jāta means every living entity is born fools. Therefore there are so many educational institution. If the man born... May be in very high family or in high nation, but he is a fool. Otherwise, what is the necessity of so many educational institution? It is a fact.
So that foolishness, when it is come to light... That is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam [SB 5.5.5]. This foolishness will continue so long as he does not come to the platform of understanding self-realization. Otherwise, all these universities and institution for imparting knowledge, they are continuation of that same ignorance and foolishness. Unless one comes to the point of understanding, "What I am? What is God? What is this world? What is my relationship...?" Unless these questions come into one's heart, and there is no proper answer, he continues to be foolish like animal, and he is subjected to different species of life, transmigration from one body to another. This is ignorance.
So this is a very risky civilization. I may feel very comfortable, that "I am a spiritual master," or you may think very comfortable, "I am born of a very rich nation, America," but this status of my life is temporary. I will have to change. I'll have to change. So if I do not change for the better, then my life is very risky. Suppose a healthy man, if he is in the society of contamination, is it not his life is very risky? He may be contaminated and infected by disease any moment.
So this ignorance should be dissipated. Here it is said that such a devotee can properly discharge his duty of human life. Those who do not do so are eating only sins. Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpaṁ ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt [Bg. 3.13]. Anyone who is cooking for himself... The difference between..., of cooking here in this temple and in ordinary house is that in ordinary house they're cooking sins. The cooking, it appears that the same, "These people are also cooking," but this cooking and that cooking is different. Here there is no sin, because it is being cooked for Kṛṣṇa. Yajñārthe. Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra [Bg. 3.9].
Beyond this field of activities, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything you are doing, pious or impious, you are become implicated with the laws of nature. Generally, you are being implicated in sinful activities. Generally. And those who are little more cautious, they avoid sinful activities; they act pious activities. But even there is pious activities, he is implicated.
This I have explained several times, that if a man is pious, he has to take his birth in rich family, janmaiśvarya-śruta [SB 1.8.26], in a very aristocratic family, rich family. He may become next life very learned scholar, very beautiful. These are the results of pious activities. But pious or impious, you have to enter into the womb of some mother. That tribulation is very severe. That we have forgotten. That we have forgotten. Either you take birth in a very rich family, aristocratic family, or you take birth in the animal womb, so the pangs of birth, death, disease and old age will continue.
So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to make a solution of these four things: birth, death, old age and disease. So if we act sinfully and if we eat sinfully, then this life of birth, death, old age will continue. Otherwise, you can make a solution, and as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. 4.9]: "After leaving this body," tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti, "he does not take birth again in this material world." Then where does he go? He's finished? Just like voidist? No. Mām eti: "He comes to Me." Mām eti. "He comes to Me." "And what is the benefit of going there, to You?"
mām upetya kaunteya
duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam
nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ
saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ
[Bg. 8.15]
"To come back to Me, that is the highest perfection of life. He does not come to this miserable world."
So we should be careful not to eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa, prasādam. That should be determination. We cannot purchase things from the market and eat. No. That is not possible. We cannot eat. We can simply eat such things which are offered to the Deity, Kṛṣṇa. That is yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ [Bg. 3.13]. Even if we have committed some sin, by eating this prasādam we counteract it. Mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ. Yajña-śiṣṭa... Aśiṣṭa means the remnants of foodstuff after offering yajña. If one eats, then mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ. Because our life is sinful, so we become, I mean to say, freed from the sinful activities. How it is? That is also stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, that ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi [Bg. 18.66]: "If you surrender unto Me, then I'll give you protection from all sinful reaction."
So if you make it a vow that "I shall not eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa," that means it is a surrender. You surrender to Kṛṣṇa, that "My dear Lord, I shall not eat anything which is not offered to You." That's vow. That vow is surrender. And because there is surrender, you are protected from the sinful reaction.
All right. All right. Now you can... Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]

Devotee (1): This explains that the human form of life is meant for realizing our spiritual nature, our nature as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. [indistinct] material servants. It explains that those who do not cultivate this kind of knowledge, they simply live like the animals, like the swine. [indistinct] without caring for the spiritual nature. They are known as ātma-han, killers of the soul, and they will enter into the planets of the [indistinct].
Prabhupāda: No, I wanted that's true, kurvann eva. That is true, yes. That's all right. So anyone will explain this,
kurvann eveha karmāṇi
jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ
evaṁ tvayi nānyatheto 'sti
na karma lipyate nare
[Īśo mantra 2]
So you should try to read the explanation, these word meanings. So kurvann eveha karmāṇi jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ. Samāḥ means years. You can live hundreds of years if you understand the philosophy of life. Otherwise, what is the use of living? The trees are also living for five hundred years, for thousands years. There is one tree in San Francisco... What is that wood?
Devotee (2): Redwood.
Prabhupāda: Redwood. No. There is some wood, I forget. Crossing bridge. Anyway, they told me that this tree is standing for seven thousand years. So the trees are also living, and you are also living. You are trying to live. Whenever there is question of death, you resist. That means you do not want to die. That is natural sequence.
So here it is said that why should you live? Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, ke lāgi āche, āchi..., that "Why I am living? I could not achieve love of Godhead. Then what is the use of my living?" He's lamenting. Narottama dāsa kena na lāgilā māriyā. Kena bā āchaye prāṇa ki sukha lāgiyā [Song 41: Ākṣepa]. He said, "Why I am living? What is the purpose of my living? What is the ultimate happiness?" Better I would have died, because I could not attain love of Godhead.”
That is real life. We should not try to live if we do not develop love of Godhead. Otherwise, the trees are also living; what is the difference? You are, what... How many years you can live? Say utmost hundred years, that's all. But the tree is living for seven thousand years, five thousand years. You cannot compete even with the tree, so far living is concerned.
So here it is said, kurvann eveha karmāṇi: one may aspire to live for hundreds of years if he continuously goes on doing work in that way. Which way? īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. Everything belongs to God. Our this society, Kṛṣṇa conscious society, we are not dismantling society. No. Not like Māyāvādī. Māyāvādī says this is…, this world, this material world is false. Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā. “Let us give it up just like we give up stool, urine, and don’t aspire after it.” Similarly, the Māyāvādīs says, “Give it up just like you leave your stool and urine, and take to brahma.” But our philosophy is not like that.
Our philosophy, we have created a Kṛṣṇa conscious society. We are having wives, children, brother, sister, father, mother. That is society. So we have got everything here. In which way we are lacking, that there is no father, there is no mother, there is no husband, there is no wife, there is no children? No, it is not negation. How these children are coming to receive? Just like in an ordinary family when the grandfather comes, little children takes pleasure, and the grandfather takes pleasure. Here the same thing is there; we are not denying. I do not say, “Oh I am a sannyāsī. Oh, you do not send these children to me. I have left my children. Why another children would come and bother me?” [laughter] No! [laughter] It is not like that. We are changing the face of the society: Kṛṣṇa conscious society.
Kṛṣṇera saṁsāra koro chāḍi anācāra [Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura]. Our propaganda is that let us become the member of Kṛṣṇa’s family. That is our program. And if we enter into Kṛṣṇa’s family… Just like Kṛṣṇa is enjoying with His consort. So there is nothing negation; everything is there. Kṛṣṇa is eating, Kṛṣṇa is enjoying, Kṛṣṇa is dancing, Kṛṣṇa is offering His prasādam—reciprocation. Nothing is denied. If we live in Kṛṣṇa consciousness then we can live for hundreds, thousands, or any number of years. Actually we do not die. What is death and birth? That is of this body. So we are eternal; Kṛṣṇa is eternal.
Our purpose is how to get out of this atmosphere where I have to repeatedly accept one body and then again quit it. And that I do not know what sort of body I am going to get next. There are 8,400,000’s of bodies, and if I get a body like that tree, red tree, standing, stand up for thou…, seven thousands of years, would you like it? But māyā is so strong that even that life, the tree, is standing seven thousand of years happily, and it is growing nicely. But those who are outside the atmosphere, they’re, “Oh, what is horrible life!” Tree is also living entity, standing for seven thousands of years, so he becomes shocked. That is human life. We should be shocked seeing so many varieties of life, abominable life. And here is a chance, this human form of life, that you can get out of this shocking atmosphere.
So this verse instructs us that if you realize that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, or God, everything should be employed in the service of the Lord. I am Lord’s..., I am part and parcel of the Lord; therefore my energy should be utilized in the service of the Lord. If you develop this consciousness, then you can live.
jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ
evaṁ tvayi nānyatheto 'sti
na karma lipyate nare
[Īśo mantra 2]
If you live like that, na lipyate nare karmani. Otherwise, every work has got some reaction if you don’t work for Kṛṣṇa. That is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitā:
yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra
loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ
[Bg. 3.9]
Yajña-arthāt: only for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's another name is Yajña, Yajñeśvara. So yajñeśvara means… Yajña means we offer sacrifice. And who is accepting? Kṛṣṇa. Our sacrifice should go to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa also explains in the Bhagavad...,
yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi
yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi
kuruṣva tat mad-arpaṇam
[Bg. 9.27]
Kṛṣṇa has... The karmis, they are working. But Kṛṣṇa says, “All right, you do.” Yat karoṣi: “Whatever you are doing, you just do it for Me, and give the result to Me.” That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You can work. You can have very big factory, working—but give the result to Kṛṣṇa. Then your, that factory-running is also as good as we are running this temple, because ultimately the profit is going to Kṛṣṇa. Why we are working for this temple, employing our energy? For Kṛṣṇa. So any field of activities, if you utilize it for Kṛṣṇa, that is wanted. In that way you can do. Jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ [Īśo mantra 2]. Otherwise, you'll be entangled; you'll be responsible.
Because when you work intentionally or unintentionally, we are committing so many sinful activities. Take, for example, that we are not in favor of animal killing; but when we walk on the street, unintentionally we are killing so many animals. You cannot get out of this entanglement. When you are drinking water, you are killing so many animals. When we are exhaling, inhaling, we are killing so many, water. When we are igniting fire, so many animals are killed. So we cannot avoid it. So if you do not devote your life for Kṛṣṇa’s service, you’ll be responsible for all these minor killings also—intentionally or unintentionally. Ignorance is not excused. If you drive unintentionally to the left side of the road, you are immediately prosecuted. You cannot say, “Oh, I was little inattentive.” No. That is not. The law of state is so strict; and how much the law of God is strict you should understand. Don't take it trifle. His agents are very…
daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī
mama māyā duratyayā
[Bg. 7.14]
You can avoid the vigilance of police, but you cannot avoid the vigilance of God. The day is witness, the night is witness, the air is witness, the sun is witness, the moon is witness. How we can avoid the sinful activities? Therefore if you want to save yourself, then you have to take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise you are doomed.

This is very important verse. Evaṁ tvayi nānyathe..., nānyathā ato asti na karma lipyate nare. If you know it that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, in this way if you live for hundreds of years and do your duties, there will be no reaction. The very thing is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā: yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9]. Except working for Kṛṣṇa, any work will bind you, good or bad. If you do good work, you'll have to enjoy, so-called enjoyment. And if you do bad work, then you have to suffer. But if you work for Kṛṣṇa, there is no such reaction. Na karma lipyate nare. All right.

Devotees:
anejad ekaṁ manaso javīyo
nainad devā āpnuvan pūrvam arṣat
tad dhāvato 'nyān atyeti tiṣṭhat
tasminn apo mātariśvā dadhāti
[Īśo mantra 4]
Prabhupāda: "The Personality of Godhead, although fixed in His abode, is more swift than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He has control over those who supply the air, rain. He surpasses all in excellence."
This is also confirmed in Brahma-saṁhitā: goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ [Bs. 5.37]. Kṛṣṇa, although He is always in Goloka Vṛndāvana, He has nothing to do. He is simply enjoying in the company of His associates, the gopīs and the cowherds boy, His mother, His father. Free, completely free. And those who are associates, they are still more free. Because when the associates are in danger, Kṛṣṇa has got some anxiety how to save them, but the associates, they have no anxiety: "Oh, there is Kṛṣṇa." Just see. [chuckles] The associates, they have no anxiety.
Any, anything happening, you will read in the Kṛṣṇa book—so many dangers. The boys, along with Kṛṣṇa, they used to go every day with their calves and cows and play in the forest on the bank of the Yamunā, and Kaṁsa will send some demon to destroy them. So you have seen; you will see also pictures. So they'll enjoy simply, because they are so much confident. That is spiritual life. Avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana [Śaraṇāgati]. This strong faith, that "Any dangerous condition, Kṛṣṇa will save me," this is surrender.
There are six phases of surrender. The first thing is that we should accept which is favorable for devotional service; we shall reject anything which is unfavorable to devotional service. And the next is that to introduce oneself with the associates of the Lord. Just like Kṛṣṇa has got so many associates, you can... That will, of course... Not artificially. When you are advanced, you'll understand what is your relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Then if you introduce yourself with that association, then the next stage is confidence that "Kṛṣṇa will give me protection."
Actually, He is giving protection to everyone. That is a fact. But in māyā we think that we are protecting ourself, we are feeding ourself. No. That's not the fact.
prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
kartāham iti manyate
[Bg. 3.27]
To the devotees, Kṛṣṇa takes charge Himself, and to the ordinary living entities, the charge is taken by māyā. Māyā is also Kṛṣṇa's agent.
Just like good citizens, they are taken care of by the government directly, and the criminals, they are taken care of by the government through the prison department, through the criminal department. They are also taken care of. In the prison house the government takes care that the prisoners not in uncomfortable—they give sufficient food; if they're diseased they give hospital treatment—every care is there, but under punishment. Similarly, we in this material world, there is care, certainly, but in..., in a punishment way. If you do this, then slap. If you do this, then kick. If you do this, then this... This is going on. This is called threefold miseries.
But under the spell of māyā we are thinking that this kicking of māyā, this slapping of māyā, this splashing of māyā is very nice. You see? This is called māyā. And as soon as you get into Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then Kṛṣṇa takes care of you. Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ [Bg. 18.66]. Kṛṣṇa, as soon as you surrender, Kṛṣṇa's immediate word is, "I take care of you. I save you from all..., from all sinful reaction."
There are heaps of sinful reaction in our life, for so many life after life in this material world. And as soon as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, immediately Kṛṣṇa takes care of you and He manages how to adjust all the sinful reactions. Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mā śucaḥ. Kṛṣṇa says, "Don't hesitate." If you think that "Oh, I have committed so many sinful activities. How Kṛṣṇa will save me?" No. Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful. He can save you. Your business is to surrender unto Him and, without any reservation, dedicate your life for His service, and thus you'll become saved.
Now thank you chant, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes. Chant.

[Īśo mantra 5]
Thank you.
Devotees: Jaya.
Prabhupāda: "The Supreme Lord walks and does not walk. He is far away, but He is very near as well. He is within everything, and again He is outside of everything."
This is the process of understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He walks and does not walk. Just like crude example I give you, that the sun and, at noontime, it is on your head, and somebody walking eastern side or western side, he also sees the sun is also walking with him. Long ago, about forty years ago, when I was householder, my second son, he was four years old. He was walking with me, and he said, "Oh, father, why the moon is coming with us?" [chuckles] This is very intelligent. Yes.
So similarly, if a material object can walk so swift... You have seen. You are going on aeroplane or train, you'll see the moon or sun is going with you. So how it is not possible that Kṛṣṇa cannot walk? Although He's situated... But you ask your friend, "Where is the sun? Where is the moon?" He'll say, "Oh, it is on my head." Similarly, goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ [Bs. 5.37]. Kṛṣṇa, although He is in Vṛndāvana, Goloka Vṛndāvana, enjoying pastimes with the associates, He is everywhere, according to the position, shape, form, activities. Everywhere.
Therefore it is said here that Supreme Lord walks and does not walk. He does not go from His abode. He is fully enjoying. But at the same time, everywhere He is. Everywhere He's walking. Just like we offer foodstuff. So do not think that Kṛṣṇa is not accepting. Kṛṣṇa is accepting, because He can spread His hand immediately if you offer something with devotion. Tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam aśnāmi [Bg. 9.26]. Kṛṣṇa says, "Anyone offering Me..., offering Me something with faith and love, I eat." People may ask, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is far away, in Goloka Vṛndāvana. How He eats? How He takes?" Oh, that is God. Yes, He can take. Therefore it is said, "He walks; He does not walk." Immediately comes.
But you must have the qualification to call Him. If you are actually a devotee, immediately Kṛṣṇa is present. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu challenged devotee Prahlāda, "Where is your God? Do you think...?" The Prahlāda was looking to the column. "Oh, do you think your God is here? All right." He immediately broke. "Ahh!" Kṛṣṇa came. Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa. Yes.
So this is explained here. This is Vedic mantra. This is the proof, Veda mantra. Why we are attached to Veda mantra? Veda mantra is the proof of everything. Whatever is said in the Vedas, that is fact. Unless you take some axiomatic truth in that way, you cannot make progress. Just like in geometry there are so many axiomatic truth, we have to accept it. "A point has no length, no breadth." "Things equal to the same thing are equal to one another." These are axiomatic truths. Similarly the Vedas, they are truth. We have to accept.
Just like I've given example in my book: The conchshell is the bone of an animal. So Vedic injunction is if you touch the bone of an animal, immediately you become impure and you have to take your bath. But here is a bone which is used in the Deity room. But you cannot argue, "Oh, you said that bone is impure. As soon as you touch it, you become impure. And you are putting into the Deity room?" No argument. You have to accept it. This is Veda. You cannot argue.
Similarly, spiritual master's order, you have to accept. There is no argument. In this way you can make progress. Sādhu śāstra guru vākya tinete kariyā aikya [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura]. If we argue... Na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet. Acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet [Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma parva 5.22]. Things which are inconceivable by you, you cannot argue. Then it will be a failure. You have to accept that axiomatic truth. It is not dogmatic. It is not dogmatic in this sense: because our predecessor ācāryas, they accepted. What you are that you are arguing?
So that is the proof. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ [Cc. Madhya 17.186]. Tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā. If you argue, there is no conclusion. The argument will go on. You put some argument; I put some argument. That is not the process. Śrutayo vibhinnā. Scriptures, in different countries, different circumstances, different scriptures, they're also different. Then tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam: and so far philosophical speculation is concerned, one philosopher is putting some theory, another philosopher putting some theory—there is contradiction. And unless you defy another philosopher, you cannot be a famous philosopher. That is the way of philosophical...
Then where, how to get real information? That is stated, that dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyām. The secret of religious process is lying in the cave, or within the heart. So how to realize it? Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ [Cc. Madhya 17.186]. You have to follow great personalities. Therefore we are trying to follow Lord Kṛṣṇa or Lord Caitanya. That is perfection. You have to take evidences from the Vedas. You have to follow the instruction. The success is sure. That's all.
Thank you very much.

"A person who sees everything in relation to the Supreme Lord and sees all entities as His parts and parcels, and who sees the Supreme Lord within everything, never hates anything, nor any being."
This is the stage of mahā-bhāgavata. In devotional service there are three stages. In the beginning it is called neophyte stage, beginners. The beginners are concentrated in the Deity worship. That is very important thing, to purify.
arcāyām eva haraye
[pūjāṁ] yas tu śraddhayehate
na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu
sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ
[SB 11.2.47]
Prākṛtaḥ means from material platform, one is coming to the spiritual platform. At that stage one is taught or trained to worship the Deity with great faith and devotion under regulative principle. But in the neophyte stage, na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu, he, the neophyte devotee, cannot understand who is highly elevated or devotee or what is his interest with other people. He cannot discriminate. Na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ. That neophyte devotee is almost material.
Then next stage is to make friendship, to love God and to make friendship with devotees, and to be merciful to the innocent and to reject the atheist. Four classes of men. You have to offer all your love for Kṛṣṇa and you have to make friendship with the devotees of Kṛṣṇa. And those who are innocent, just preach this Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and try to attract them to Kṛṣṇa. And another class, atheists, don't go there. Don't try there. Hopeless. Not hopeless; for a person who is not very much elevated, for him it is hopeless.
But when one is on the higher stage of devotional service, that system is explained here:
yas tu sarvāṇi bhūtāny
ātmany evānupaśyati
sarva bhūteṣu cātmānaṁ
tato na vijugupsate
[Īśo mantra 6]
He has no discrimination who is devotee, who is nondevotee, who is atheist or theist, or who is... In this way, he sees everyone the part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. And everyone is engaged... One who is suffering, he's also engaged, because... Just like the prisoner. The prisoner, he's also serving the government—by force. Therefore one who is elevated, even those who are in abominable stage of life, the mahā-bhāgavata sees, "Oh, he's also obeying." Actually, it is obeying. The prisoners, they are obeying the government, although by force, but they're obeying.
Similarly, those who are materialist, they are also obeying. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's this philosophy, that jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]. A living entity's eternally servant of Kṛṣṇa, either he admits or not admits. That doesn't matter. He's a servant. Just like any citizen is law abider or subservient to the state. He may say that "I don't care for the state," by the police, by the military, he'll be forced to accept.
So one is being forced to accept Kṛṣṇa as the master, and the other is voluntarily offering service. That is the difference. But nobody is free from the service of Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy that eternal servant. Either you accept or not accept, you are servant. You are never equal or greater than God.
So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for that purpose, that people should be taught that "You are eternal servant of God. Don't falsely claim that you are God, you don't care for God. You have to care." Just like this Hiraṇyakaśipu. He didn't care for God, but God came, and at the time of his last moment. You see? Similarly, God is visible to atheist as death and to the theist as lover. That is the difference. Everyone sees God. Nobody can say, "I do not see God." Everyone sees God. But one sees as death, and one sees as lover. That is the difference.

"One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What is there as illusion or anxiety for him?"
This realization is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There are different kinds of realization, but ekatvam, a qualitatively oneness, is always there. The brahmavādi, impersonalist, they think that we are cent percent one with the Lord, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, but that is not a fact. If one is cent percent one with the Supreme Lord, then how he has come under the control of māyā? This question they cannot answer.
So real identity is in the Vedic literature we find that just like the fire, big fire, and the sparks of the fire, they are of the same quality, but the small spark, when he goes out of the fire and falls elsewhere, then, at that time, its fiery quality becomes covered. So this covering becomes manifest according to different qualities. Just like the fire. If a fire spark, if it drops on the water, then it is..., it assumes completely extinguished. Similarly, the living entity, although qualitatively the fire, with God, when it contacts the modes of ignorance, his spiritual quality becomes almost extinct.
When he is on the land, not on the water, then there is something, heat. Similarly, when the living entity is in the rajo-guṇa, the quality of passion, there is some hope. And when the living entity is in goodness... Just like the same spark, if it drops on the grass, dry grass, then the same spark of fire ignites another fire, another blazing fire. Similarly, if one is in goodness, then he can create a spiritual association. Just like the same example, that the small spark of fire, if it falls in favorable circumstances, or in dry grass, then it can ignite fire.
So one has to come, therefore, to the platform of goodness in this material world. If one does not come to the platform of goodness... The platform of goodness is the brahminical qualification. That we are preaching. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to bring some men on the platform of goodness. The world requires it now. The world is [in] need of some brāhmaṇas, qualified brāhmaṇas. Not that... You are being trained up to become qualified brāhmaṇas. So be always careful that you may not contact the quality of passion and ignorance.
Passion and ignorance will induce you... Kāma lobha, lust and greediness. That is the sign of passion and ignorance. And when you are in goodness, then you can see things as they are. Then you can see yourself, that you are not matter; you are spirit soul. And if you make further advance, then you understand that "I am eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the fiery spark."
So that ekatvam anupaśyataḥ, in this verse, ekatvam, that qualitatively one, not quantitatively. You are one with God qualitatively. You cannot be equal with God quantitatively. That ekatvam.
Thank you. Go on. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Devotees: Jaya. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Who will explain? Karandhara Prabhu, you will explain? First or second. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [pause] Which one?Karandhara: Second verse?Prabhupāda: Yes, any one, if you can... Whatever you have realized, you can say, without seeing the book. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. Yes...
Karandhara: Everything animate or inanimate in this world is controlled and owned by Kṛṣṇa. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is described that there are two types of energies of Kṛṣṇa: parā prakṛti and aparā prakṛti, the superior energy and the inferior energy. The inferior energy is made up of the gross elements earth, air, fire, water and ether, and the subtle energy, or the subtle material elements, are the sky..., excuse me, mind, intelligence and false ego. These make up the parā prakṛti, or the inferior energy of the Lord.
But the living entities, they are the superior energy of the Lord. They are aparā prakṛti; and henceforth, due to their illusion, due to their misconception, they are trying to lord it over the parā prakṛti, uh, uh, aparā prakṛti, the inferior energy of the Lord, and they have become entangled. They have become covered by these gross elements.
So when one is realizing who the source of the energies..., of all these energies are, who are the proprietor, who are the controller of the energy, then by the Lord's mercy, the Lord being the controller of all these energies, that entity can become free from the covering, from the influence of the material energy, and can resume his natural constitutional position as superior energy and function and exist on that platform in realization of both energies and his relationship with the supreme energy of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa.
One should not..., one should only accept that which is set aside for him, that which is needed. The lusty desire to gain more, to acquire more—this lust, this perversion, this misunderstanding is exactly what enamors the living entity, the parā prakṛti, in the inferior energy, aparā prakṛti. So when one can come to this understanding, that everything is controlled, everything is owned by the Supreme Lord, and that he has no proprietorship, then he can give up this false sense of "mine" and "I" and realize that the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, He is the controller, He is the owner, and can once again regain his blissful, natural state, sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. 5.1].

Prabhupāda: Hmm. Why a living entity is superior energy? Can anyone explain? Why living...? Yes? Stand up.
Devotee (1): Well, it is stated that the living entity, or the jīva soul, belongs to the jīva-tattva, that categoristic..., falls into that categoristic of the Lord's energy. He is... Spark...
Prabhupāda: No, the question is why the living entity is called superior energy? That is the question. The material..., matter—earth, water, air, fire, sky—the inferior energy; and why the living is called superior energy? Who can explain? Yes? Stand up.
Devotee (2): Well, the individual living entities are all part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa.
Prabhupāda: The part and parcel, this material energy also, part and parcel. Because energy...
Devotee: It's separated. Material energy's separated, whereas the superior energy...
Prabhupāda: Separated, and this also, living entities also separated, in this sense. One sense, nothing is separated; but at the same time, separated. But the question is why the living entity's called superior energy. Yes?
Devotee (3): The living entities are conscious whereas the material energy's not.
Prabhupāda: Yes, that is also one of the reasons. A living entity's conscious, whereas the material energy is not conscious. This is one of the... Yes?
Devotee (4): The living entity is also eternal, nonchanging, whereas the material energy is subject to change repeatedly.
Prabhupāda: Yes, that is also. And the most important is that living entity is superior in this sense, that the living entity can control over the material energy. Just like in this temple, all this paraphernalia which you have got, this is made of matter—earth, water, fire, water, and fire, air. But the living entity has molded for his purpose.
And it can utilize the material energy, just like the modern scientists, they are utilizing. Just like you American people, this land of America, before your coming from European countries, it was vacant land. The people who lived here, they could not utilize. But you have developed by your intelligence a very nice country, with industry, with nice roads.
So this is superiority, that the living entity can have some control over the material energy. That is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā: yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat [Bg. 7.5]. The..., the importance of this material world is due to the living entities. This Los Angeles city is valuable so long the living entities are there. The body's valuable so long the living entity, soul, is there. Therefore it is superior.
But that superiority is being misused. That is conditioned life. We are conditioned because our superior position than the matter, we are misusing. How we are misusing? We have forgotten that although I am superior energy than the matter, but still, I am subordinate to God. That he is forgetting. The modern civilization, they do not care for God, because people are superior than matter. They are simply trying to exploit matter in different way. But they are forgetting that we, either we may be American or Russian or China or India, we are all subordinate to God. This is the mistake. Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare [Prema-vivarta]. They have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, and they want to enjoy this material world. This is their disease.
Now our duty is to invoke their Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that "You are superior, that's all right. But you are subordinate to Kṛṣṇa." You cannot enjoy, but you can... Just like we have decorated this temple not for our sense gratification. What is the difference between our students and ordinary man? They are also decorating their apartment very nicely. We are also doing the same, but the purpose is different. We are doing it for Kṛṣṇa, and they are doing their for their...
So our superiority is that—either I am trying for decorating my personal apartment, I am trying to decorate this temple—my superiority is there because I am utilizing matter for my purpose. But when it is utilized, his intelligence is applied to utilize this matter for Kṛṣṇa, then his life is successful. The superior intelligence should be utilized for the benefit of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇārthe akhila-ceṣṭā [Cc. Madhya 22.126]. Then your life is successful. Then the same superior energy, if you apply it for your sense gratification, you'll be entangled and anxiety. And then you'll have to change your body, one after another. That is going on. So the superior..., supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa, either on this inferior energy or superior energy.
So superior energy means that we can control over the material world. Not completely. That is also under condition. But we have got some control over this material world. But Kṛṣṇa has control over us also. We cannot do anything out of our own whims. Just like we are manufacturing this nice microphone with intelligence. Just like you American people, you are manufacturing so many nice things, and why other people, they cannot manufacture? What is the reason?
You are also superior energy, and before you, the Red Indians, they are also superior energy. The animal, he's also superior energy. The cow, for example, that is also living entity, superior energy, and a man, he's also living entity, superior energy. But the man is sending the cow to the slaughterhouse. It is helpless, and the man is powerful. How this distinction? How this distinction?
That distinction is due to the superior controller, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has given man superior intelligence. Superior intelligence... In the Bhagavad-gītā, Fifteenth Chapter, fifteenth verse, you'll find that sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo [Bg. 15.15]: "I am sitting within the heart of everyone." Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca. "One can memorize or forget on account of Me." Therefore the superior energy is giving intelligence to the human form of body, that "You do this." "You do this" means not whimsically. He wanted to do it, but sometimes he forgets, and Kṛṣṇa reminds, "You wanted to do this? You can do this. Here is an opportunity."
So although I have got superior intelligence, that is also controlled by Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa gives you intelligence, then you can manufacture this nice microphone; otherwise, you cannot. Therefore īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]. In every sphere of life, there is control of Kṛṣṇa. Yat kiñcit jagatyām. Anything which is going on within this world, jagat... Jagat means this world, which is making progress.
Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā. Therefore we shall have to voluntarily accept His superiority and accept only prasādam, whatever He kindly allows, "You can take this." "All right, Sir." That's all. You cannot encroach upon others. That is superior control. But the people are encroaching; therefore they are becoming entangled. If they accept what is offered by Kṛṣṇa, then there is no trouble. But if they encroach, then there is trouble.
So you read every śloka, every mantra. Whenever you get time, you read the purport, you read the meaning. The whole philosophy is there. Now as you are growing, there will be so many questions, so many philosophers. But our philosophy is so sound and solid that we can meet any philosopher of the world. Any philosopher. But you have to learn it. The books are there, your intelligence is there, the guidance is there. Because you are preaching, sometimes we have to meet opposing elements. So if you cannot answer properly, that will be disqualification.
So every one of you should learn this philosophy. As soon as you are able to, I mean to say, guide yourself, or save yourself from the attack of the opposing element, then you'll know that you are making progress. Otherwise... Of course, there are different stages of devotional life. But so far we are concerned, we have to preach. That is the second platform of devotional life.
In the second platform, not only to love God, but to make friendship with devotees who is loving God. That is society. Our Society is devotees. We should not only practice to love God, but we should make friendship and love the devotees also. And then those who are innocent, those who do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa, we shall preach. And those who are atheist, against God, we shall avoid. So this is second stage. And on the highest stage, of course, there is no... He is paramahaṁsa.
So that, don't try to imitate paramahaṁsa. That is very topmost stage of devotional life. Even if you are on this topmost stage, when you are preacher you have come to the second platform, this stage. So you have to raise yourself from the lower stage to the second stage, and if you are in the highest stage even, then you have come to the second stage for preaching work.
So preaching work, four vision—īśvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca [SB 11.2.46]: God, Kṛṣṇa; His devotee; innocent; and the atheist. So we are concerned with three: with God, the devotees and the innocent: to love God, to make friendship with devotees and to teach the innocent. And those who are atheist, against God, avoid. Don't talk. Useless waste of time. Whatever he wants: "All right, sir, you are very great." That's all right. [laughter] [chuckles] Don't talk with them. Simply waste of time. But if one is inquisitive... Just like this child, he wants to learn. As I say, "Oh, offer your obeisances," he does it. Oh, he should be taken care, very much developed.
But that is also one of the offenses, out of the ten offenses. One who is disinclined to understand what is this chanting, you should not bother yourself to convince him. That's all. Just like in hospital, especially in the war field, there are many wounded soldiers are coming. But the doctors see that the soldier which has got the chance of living, take care more for them. And the soldier which is immediately going to die, they do not take care much. Because it is useless; he'll not live.
Similarly the atheist, the atheist will have to suffer. They will have to meet God in the form of death in so many ways. So by suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering, when a day will come that he'll understand God, at that time, preaching to him is better. So you do not expect that our preaching will be appeal to everyone. It will be useful for the devotees, for the innocent. Not for the atheist.
So try to understand the philosophy very nicely, because you are going to preach. So many opposing elements will come. So you have to defend yourself. The more you can defend yourself from the opposing elements, the more you are advancing. You should know... That is the test. That is the test. Because you are preacher, so you have to test yourself, how you are making advance. Don't be self-complacent: "Oh, I am very..., I have advanced very much." Your advancement will be tested when you can meet opposing elements. Not that when the opposing elements come, "Oh, let him talk with Guru Mahārāja, or spiritual master." Why? What for you are being taught?
So you should be very careful to understand the philosophy. Otherwise, you are not making progress. Progress means you shall defend yourself from the opposing elements. That is progress.
Thank you. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
